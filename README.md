## üìù Overview

NAP is a Shiny-based web application designed to profile the topology of medium-scale networks (up to a few thousand edges) and facilitate direct comparison through an intuitive interface. It bridges graph-theoretical metrics with systems biology needs, enabling users to explore, rank, and compare network topology seamlessly.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Topological Exploration**: Compute and visualize metrics such as degree, betweenness, closeness, clustering coefficient and more.
* **Node & Edge Ranking**: Rank elements by any computed metric and export results as tables or plots.
* **Multi-Network Comparison**: Load multiple networks simultaneously to compare topological properties side-by-side.
* **Feature Distributions**: Plot distributions of any topological feature across networks.
* **Feature Correlation**: Generate scatter plots of one metric against another to uncover relationships.
* **Dynamic & Static Layouts**: Visualize networks using layouts like Fruchterman‚ÄìReingold, Kamada‚ÄìKawai, circular, grid, and interactive 3D layers.
